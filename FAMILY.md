# The family standard

These sixteen repositories are one family and are held to one standard. Where
they differ, the difference must be something the hardware forces, not something
nobody got round to.

## The authority ladder

Every factual question is answered by the highest rung that has an answer, and a
lower rung never overrules a higher one.

1. **Manufacturer documentation.** Anything printed decides. Read it in full
   rather than searching it, because the passages that matter are the ones
   nobody quotes.
2. **The part's own program or the artefact itself.** A cartridge, a firmware
   image, a header. What the silicon was actually asked to do.
3. **A recording from an independent implementation**, for behaviour nobody
   documented.
4. **Nothing else.** An emulator, an FPGA core, a wiki and a forum post are rung
   3 at best and rung 4 for anything printed.

A document that contradicts itself is common. When it does, the cycle table and
the pin descriptions have both times been right and the prose wrong.

**Never calibrate against an emulator where a document exists.** A recording is
evidence about behaviour nobody wrote down. It is not evidence about a register
width, a bit name, or anything else a manufacturer printed, however many
implementations agree with it. Where a recording contradicts a document, the
document wins, the disagreement is written down, and the model follows the
document.

**A recording whose answer depends on the machine it was built on is not evidence
at all.** It is a property of the recorder, and it is excluded and named rather
than allowed to decide.

## What every repository carries

| Gate | Standard |
|:--|:--|
| Format | `ruff format --check .`, clean |
| Lint | `ruff check .`, zero findings |
| Types | `mypy` at strict plus every optional error class, zero findings |
| Tests | `<module>.test.py` beside the module, run individually |
| Coverage | 100% statement and branch, enforced, on a machine holding no artefacts |
| JSON | `pnpm run format:check`, with every submodule tree exempted |
| CI | lint, types, tests on 3.12/3.13/3.14, plus the project's own conformance job |
| Schedule | a weekly run against unpinned tools and the newest runtime, starting on ground the pipeline never reaches |
| Analysis | CodeQL and Scorecard |
| Release | semantic-release from `main`, never tagged by hand |
| Docs | README, AGENTS.md plus the one-line pointer each tool reads, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT |
| Review | CODEOWNERS on every path, and templates that ask a report for the run that settles it |
| Specs | `specs/current/`, requirements with checkable scenarios |
| Hardware facts | `conformance/hardware.json`, every fact with the sentence it came from |
| Disagreements | `conformance/divergences.json`, both readings and what would settle it |

## Conventions that are not negotiable

| Thing | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Language | Python only |
| Comments | None in source, ever. Docstrings carry the reasoning |
| Test structure | Arrange, blank line, one act, blank line, assert. No section labels |
| Nothing starts clean | Memory and registers hold what they held, from a seed |
| Artefacts | Never committed: no ROM, no firmware, no fragment of one |
| Only retail dumps | A ROM hack is somebody's edit, not what hardware ran |
| Package manager | pnpm, never npm |

## What a conformance runner must report

A runner asked about ground it has never been held to has three options and two
of them are lies. Reporting agreement lies about the part. Skipping in silence
lies about the run, because the summary then counts a comparison that never
happened. The third is to refuse: name what was compared, name what was not and
why, and count the two apart.

Report per part, never one number over parts with different evidence. One part
held to its manufacturer's manual and another held to nothing are not one figure.

## The state of this repository
## The state of this repository

**This package has no model of the part, and that is the design.** It runs the
microcode masked into the silicon, on a model of the processor NEC documents, so
what it answers is what that program answers. A reimplementation of a masked
program is a reimplementation of somebody's reading of it; running the program
removes the reading.

**What running the program cannot remove is everything around it.** The port
decode, the pacing, the read semantics and the boot handshake all sit between a
caller and an answer, and any of them can change what comes back while the
microcode stays byte for byte the same.
[`conformance/hardware.json`](conformance/hardware.json) is about those, and it
marks each one.

**Three of the five figures are documented.** One instruction per clock and the
8.3 MHz ceiling come from NEC's data sheet through the processor package that
pins it. The two access costs come from the bus speeds in Nintendo's Map Mode
table, through the mapper. None of the three is copied here, because a fact in
two files is a fact that will drift.

**The cartridge oscillator is not documented, and it is load-bearing.** 7.6 MHz
is the crystal on the board rather than a property of the part, so no NEC
document would carry it and Nintendo's manual does not either. It is what every
implementation uses, which is the weakest source this project accepts, and it
decides how many instructions the part runs between two console accesses. That
is exactly the number that decides whether a driver catches the part before it
has finished. A photograph of a DSP-1 board showing the crystal marking would
settle it.

**The master clock is derived from the NTSC relationship** rather than from
Nintendo, and is marked here for the same reason it is marked in the mapper.

**One recorded disagreement with a behavioural model**, in
[`conformance/divergences.json`](conformance/divergences.json), with the exact
bytes that produce it and what it does not establish. The direction is the
interesting part: the part's own program answers one thing and a reimplementation
of that program answers another.
